Dear Visitor,

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here you'll find a glimpse into my journey, aspirations, and the projects that drive my passion for data science and artificial intelligence.

# Introduction
My name is Maarten, and I'm on a mission to transition into a career where I can leverage data science and AI to make impactful contributions, particularly in the realm of healthcare. This document provides additional context to my motivation to pursue the AI and Data Science course at BeCode, as well as insights into my background, skills, and future aspirations.

# Background
Throughout my career, I've found myself gravitating towards managerial roles due to my aptitude for leadership and strategic thinking. However, my passion lies in the technical aspects of data science and AI. You can delve into my CV to see how my roles have consistently involved managing people, but my heart yearns for more hands-on technical work.

# Motivation
The prospect of working on innovative projects at the intersection of healthcare and technology excites me immensely. Two specific projects have sparked my interest and serve as beacons guiding my journey:

## Cardiac Monitoring with Headphone Technology
I'm fascinated by the potential of using headphones to measure heart rate and differentiate between various cardiac irregularities. The project showcased by Google researchers using audioplethysmography (APG) presents a promising avenue for non-invasive remote patient monitoring, potentially revolutionizing healthcare.

# Learning Journey
I am deeply committed to continuous learning and improvement in the field of data science and AI. My dedication is evident from my achievements on Datacamp, where I consistently ranked in the top 1% of learners and maintained a longest daily learning streak of 96 days.

Feel free to explore my Datacamp profile to see the courses and projects I've completed, showcasing my ability to apply data science skills to real-world challenges.

# Academic Background
I hold a master's degree, as evidenced by my thesis focusing on the application of data analysis techniques in healthcare. This thesis demonstrates my proficiency in analyzing small datasets and effectively communicating findings to stakeholders. However, I acknowledge the need to enhance my programming and technical skills to tackle larger datasets and complex projects.
