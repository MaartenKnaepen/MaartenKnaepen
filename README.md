# Projects Showcase

### CellScope

- **Description**: CellScope is an advanced project that demonstrates my expertise in computer vision, machine learning, and healthcare applications. It's designed to assist in the identification and analysis of white blood cells in peripheral blood smear images. Key features include:
  - White Blood Cell Detection using object detection models (YOLO)
  - White Blood Cell Classification into different types (basophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils) using fastai
  - Comprehensive model evaluation metrics including confusion matrices, precision-recall curves, and F1 curves
  - User-friendly interface for image upload and analysis

- **Technologies Used**: YOLO, fastai, Streamlit, Python, Hugging Face Model Hub

- **Live Demo**: [CellScope App](https://cellscope.streamlit.app/)

- **GitHub Repository**: [CellScope](https://github.com/MaartenKnaepen/CellScope)

- **Model Repositories**:
  - [Detection Model on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/MaartenKnaepen/cellscope-detection)
  - [Identification Model on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/MaartenKnaepen/cellscope-identification)

This project showcases my ability to develop end-to-end machine learning solutions for real-world problems, particularly in the medical field. It demonstrates my skills in implementing complex computer vision models, creating intuitive user interfaces, and deploying machine learning applications.

### Chess Tutor Chatbot

- **Description**: This project showcases my skills in natural language processing, vector databases, and application deployment. I developed an interactive chatbot using OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model to answer chess-related questions. The chatbot utilizes a FAISS vector store for efficient document retrieval, combining retrieved information with the language model to generate accurate responses. Key features include:
  - Interactive chat interface for chess-related queries
  - Efficient document retrieval using FAISS vector store
  - Integration of retrieved documents with GPT-3.5-turbo for contextual responses
  - Custom UI with tailored images and backgrounds
  - Deployment on Streamlit for easy access and interaction

- **Technologies Used**: OpenAI API, FAISS, Streamlit, Python

- **Live Demo**: [Chess Tutor Chatbot](https://chesstutor.streamlit.app)

- **Additional Info**: [About Page](https://chesstutor.streamlit.app/About)

- **GitHub Repository**: [Chess Tutor Chatbot](https://github.com/MaartenKnaepen/chesstutor)

This project demonstrates my ability to integrate advanced AI models with efficient data retrieval systems, create user-friendly interfaces, and deploy functional AI applications.

### Metal Classifier Project
- **Description**: This project demonstrates my proficiency in deep learning and data scraping. It involves training a deep learning model to classify metal music samples into different subgenres using mel spectrograms. The project also includes exploratory data analysis and validation methods.
